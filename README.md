# About
A lightweight project skeleton for [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) games that takes
inspiration from [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). It's geared toward low-spec
pixel-art games, and includes libraries to get you up and running as soon as you
fork the repo.

# Cleanup For Usage
You can safely delete this README and the entire `src/sample` folder.

Make sure to delete the line `require("src.sample")` in `main.lua`.
